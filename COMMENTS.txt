This package contains:
- Complete Express app with JWT auth (routes under /api)
- Model files: Product, CartItem, User (Mongoose)
- Validation using express-validator
- Seed script to populate sample products and test user
- thunder_collection.json for ThunderClient/Postman import

How to get screenshots for MongoDB:
1. Start MongoDB and run `npm run seed`.
2. Open MongoDB Compass or Atlas UI and navigate to `shoppyglobe` DB.
3. Open `products` collection, take a screenshot.
4. Add items to cart via API, then open `cartitems` collection and take a screenshot.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add extra routes (update product, delete product) and admin protection.
- Provide a ready-made set of ThunderClient screenshots (I cannot access your DB to take screenshots).
